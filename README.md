# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2022
A repository of machine learning online course delivered by DataTalks.Club. More about the course is available on this [page](https://datatalks.club/blog/machine-learning-zoomcamp.html).

Breakdown structure of this course into two parts: 
- Machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Classification, Trees (Decision Tree and Ensembles such as Random Forest and XGBoost), and Deep Learning. Python, Scikit-learn, Keras and TensorFlow are main libraries in this development stage. 
- Bringing machine learning into practical applications to solve problems in real-world scenarios with Flask, FastAPI, Docker and Kubernetes.
