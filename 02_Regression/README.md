### Week 2: Regression

This covers aspects of predicting continuous-type values according to the statistical distribution of features. Concepts and principles important to understand:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is very helpful in identifying the nature and behavior of data (mostly missing values, format inconsistencies, conflicting types, etc.). It also guides us in addressing possible issues in relation to the problems before choosing which algorithm has mathematical suitability to produce output relevant to our goal.
- Regression model is composed of vector elements produced from dot product. Weights and biases are iteratively updated in process. A dummy feature may be required to adjust feature vectors that allows for dot product to be computed.
- Regularization makes use of identity matrix that modifies diagonal elements of matrix multiplication that help reducing the effect of numerical instability that incur extreme values of weights and biases.
- Measuring the goodness of model fit against the distribution: MSE, RMSE, MAE.
